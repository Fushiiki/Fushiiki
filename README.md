##~$ echo "Hello world!" ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fushiiki, i'm currently working as a Cyber Analyst & Pen Tester.
I'll be mainly using Github to create my own projects in C and Python & follow/fork Pen Testing tools.
I'm very interested in low level programming language and in general how devices works under the hood.
